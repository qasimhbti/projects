# Thanks for joining me!

I hope you've enjoyed the project, it's always good to solidify the things you learn in courses by getting your hands dirty with a real project. Remember to add this project to your Github profile, it can be useful as proof-of-knowledge in interviews and on your resume.

## Ideas for extending the project

* Use SQLite or PostgresQL instead of a JSON file for your database layer
* Let users save other data with their posts, maybe an image URL?
* Add proper authentication to each request, you could even use my [password validator](https://github.com/wagslane/go-password-validator)
* Add more unit tests!
* Deploy your api on AWS, GCP, or Digital Ocean
* Dockerize it
* Add documentation using markdown files
* Write a client that interacts with the API, maybe a webpage or a mobile app
